# Security procedure
This code repository generates a static website, and so minimal live code execution vulnerabilities are expected. If you notice security vulnerabilities, please raise an issue.

If you suspect the issue should be disclosed privately, please email [admin@openuk.uk](mailto:admin@openuk.uk).

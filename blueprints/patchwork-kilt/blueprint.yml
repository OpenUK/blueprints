        approach:
          - "With flexible working and edge computing as rising trends, there will be less office and retail space requirements in city centres and more central data centre requirements for edge computing."
          - "Combining these trends presents an opportunity to reuse existing buildings, minimising reliance on new construction materials, and eliminating most of the embodied carbon associated with new buildings. "
          - "Refurbishing to high environmental standards will also improve site energy efficiency, waste management and heat reuse."

        approach:

        approach:
          - "Open hardware, optimised by open software, with a circular model in order to keep assets in highest utility value for as long as possible, maximising lifetime value and sustainability. This requires:"
          - Internal repair, reuse and reclaim
          - Rack scale recertification
          - Remanufacturing for edge form factors
          - Recertification and remarketing of components
          - Responsible recycling
          - This recertification avoids corresponding amount of emissions tied to manufacturing and enables a zero carbon IT supply chain.
        impacts:
          - "Combined with an open architecture approach:"
          - Capex Reduced by up to 50%
          - Opex Reduced by up to 30%
          - GHG Emissions reduced by up to 25%
          - Dematerialisation of Data Centre by up to 90%

        name: "Open Architecture"
        approach:
          - "An open architecture enables the circularity required to achieve carbon zero."
          - Open hardware leverages standard components, enabling recertification, reconfiguration, testing and integration to lower capex and opex while reducing GHG emissions from extended lifetime and delayed reliance on new materials.
          - Open systems firmware enables updates and security across multiple lifetimes, lowering opex.
          - An open architecture is also best suited for enabling innovation through its broad support, cost accessibility and flexibility.
        impacts:
          - "Combined with server and racks approach:"
          - Capex Reduced by up to 50%
          - Opex Reduced by up to 30%
          - GHG Emissions reduced by up to 25%

        approach:
          - Cooling accounts for up to 40% of all energy consumed by data centres. 
          - Closed looped water cooling systems, combined with OCP architecture to leverage full power and space efficiency, is emerging as the leading cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution to cooling. 
          - Heat generated in data centres should be repurposed towards applications which can benefit from it, for example sustainable agriculture, or leverage an edge-based architecture to recycle heat into the homes of marginalised communities in order to reduce costs and replace the reliance on natural gas.
        impacts:
          - Power and cooling costs reduced by up to 30%
          - CO2 and Pollution reduction of up to 30%

        name: "Transparency & reporting requirements"
        approach:
          - Reducing critical Scope 3 emissions is highly dependent on the transparency, reporting and commitment from the entire supply chain. 
          - Voluntary reporting has demonstrated inconsistency in data and lack of transparency, so the introduction of regulations to ensure full transparency and reporting across all scopes (1,2,3) is required. 
          - Furthermore, governments should require full transparency and disclosure from their data centre supply chain.
          - "An open data model is essential to enable collaboration and public benefit."

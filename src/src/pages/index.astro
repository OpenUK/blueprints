  <h1>Explore the blueprints</h1>
  <p>
    Here, we are committed to sharing detailed technical guides designed to pave
    the way for a sustainable and standardized technology future.
  </p>

  <h2>What is a Blueprint?</h2>
  <p>
    In traditional terms, a blueprint refers to a detailed technical drawing.
    It's often a foundational plan or a map for architects and engineers to
    craft structures and systems that stand the test of time.
  </p>
  <p>
    According to <a
      href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blueprint"
      target="_blank" class="underline text-openuk-blue hover:text-blue-700">Wiktionary</a
    >, one of the closest dictionary definitions is:
    <blockquote
      class="bg-openuk-grey border-l-4 border-openuk-blue pl-4 py-2 mt-4 font-sans text-gray-900 mb-6"
    >
      <em>(architecture, engineering, by extension)</em> A detailed technical drawing
      (now often in some electronically storable and transmissible form).
    </blockquote>
  </p>

  <p>
    For OpenUK, a Blueprint is a comprehensive guide or roadmap for creating
    sustainable and standardised technology infrastructure. Each Blueprint is
    developed by a diverse group of volunteers and experts from both the public
    and private sectors, encompassing:
  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-4 mb-4">
    <li class="mb-2">A detailed plan of the required components.</li>
    <li class="mb-2">Insight into the impacts these components create.</li>
    <li>
      Formulation based on the principles of open source software, open
      hardware, and open data.
    </li>
  </ul>

  At the core, each Blueprint is the product of collaborative minds. It's
  developed by a diverse group of volunteers and experts from both the public
  and private sectors, ensuring that every perspective is considered and the
  best solutions are put forth.

  <h2>Why the Emphasis on Blueprints?</h2>

  As our world becomes increasingly digital and connected, the ICT industry
  faces a pressing challenge. The global demand for data and digital services is
  exponentially growing. But with this growth comes an undeniable environmental
  cost. We recognize that the ICT industry is on track to significantly increase
  its carbon footprint, and the data centres — the backbone of the industry —
  play a pivotal role in this. We also recognize the challenge and opportunity
  in addressing waste, inefficiency, and the lack of standardized solutions.
  Blueprints serve as a beacon in this vast landscape, providing:

  <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-4 mb-4">
    <li class="mb-2">
      Sustainable Solutions: Each blueprint is rooted in sustainability. Whether
      it's about maximizing energy efficiency or advocating for a circular
      economy, blueprints are designed with the future of our planet in mind.
    </li>
    <li class="mb-2">
      Open Collaboration: By embracing the principles of open source software,
      open hardware, and open data, we ensure that the blueprints can be easily
      accessed, modified, and improved upon. This open approach encourages
      collaboration and innovation.
    </li>
    <li>
      Standardization: As the industry grows, standardization becomes crucial.
      Our blueprints offer a consistent roadmap for creating technology
      infrastructure that meets set standards and is universally adaptable.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Dive into Our Featured Blueprints</h2>

  <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6">
    {
      getBlueprintDataFromFolder().map((blueprint) => (
        <BlueprintCard
          title={blueprint.title}
          description={blueprint.description}
          link={"blueprints/" + blueprint.path}
          lastUpdated={blueprint.lastUpdated}
        />
      ))
    }
  </div>
  <h2>What happens if we don't work together?</h2>
  <p>
    We risk creating a fragmented and unsustainable tech ecosystem. The 'not
    invented here' syndrome could cause tech companies to avoid adopting
    solutions developed elsewhere, even if they're superior. This mentality not
    only hampers cross-pollination of ideas but also leads to inefficiencies and
    duplicated efforts.
  </p><p>
    If we continue to ignore sustainability in our tech operations, the
    environmental implications could be dire. As we know, data centres are one
    of the largest consumers of electricity worldwide. If left unchecked, their
    energy consumption and the associated carbon emissions could contribute
    significantly to climate change.
  </p>
  <p>
    In essence, if we don't tackle these issues head-on, we risk not only
    impeding technological progress, but we may also exacerbate environmental
    issues and slow down the much-needed transition to more sustainable energy
    solutions.

        approach:
          - "With flexible working and edge computing as rising trends, there will be less office and retail space requirements in city centres and more central data centre requirements for edge computing."
          - "Combining these trends presents an opportunity to reuse existing buildings, minimising reliance on new construction materials, and eliminating most of the embodied carbon associated with new buildings. "
          - "Refurbishing to high environmental standards will also improve site energy efficiency, waste management and heat reuse."
